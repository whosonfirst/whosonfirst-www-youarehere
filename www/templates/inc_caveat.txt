<h2>This is important</h2>

    	    <p>There are a couple important things you should know before
    	    getting started.</p>

	<ol>
		{if $cfg.environment != 'prod'}<li>This project is still being
		cobbled together. Anything you add here may go *poof!* without notice.</li>{/if}

		<li>The idea is for all of this data to released publicly under
	as liberal a license (for the purposes of re-use) as is not-annoying.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Data dumps will <em>not</em> contain your (Twitter) username but
	<em>might</em> contain an obfuscated user identifier. This is so that
	people consuming the data can make better informed decisions about which
	assertions to trust. Or not. I am still working through the ways in
	which that might get creepy.</p>

	<p>The point is not to promote a naked Facebook-esque mirror world but
	to find an acceptable place where privacy interests and transparency can
	exist. That might not be possible and if that's the case then a user's privacy
	will take precedence.</p>
